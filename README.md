  Русский:    простая программа для создания GUI для Python, созданная на базе Tkinter для учебных целей.

  The history of Widget Creator TK began with the appearance of Python at school. And more precisely finding an analogue Lazarus for Python. I used to find Qt Designer, but for students it is more difficult. Therefore, I had to write this. It only creates a Tkinter graphical interface, the code must be written.

  To create a GUI, fill in the box fields, click "Fix". Then enter the coordinate facility and other parameters you want, then press to create the desired button, such as "Button". Similarly, create other widgets. To view GUI before saving, click "Test" to save "Save", to clear "Clear". There is a "secret", when you click on the "Help" button, while this window opens on the main window, the colors and the font are changed to those that you have chosen (pull back this window).

  For the work of this program, Python 3 must be installed.
